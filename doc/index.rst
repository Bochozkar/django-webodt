==============

**django-webodt** is a django module which aims to create documents in various
formats from Open Document templates (odt) and HTML templates.

Module contains three backends which allow you to use abiword, OpenOffice or
Google Docs for conversion purposes.

If you want to try it out, we encourage you to read :doc:`quickstart` before.

There you will learn how to use shortcuts, which options should be defined in
`settings.py` and what other actions should be performed to make a certain
backend work.
