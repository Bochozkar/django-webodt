django-webodt
==============

**django-webodt** is a Django module which aims to create documents in various
formats from Open Document templates (odt) and HTML templates.

You can convert documents to PDF, DOC and more with help of AbiWord, OpenOffice
or Google Docs backends.

If you want to try it out, we encourage you to read :doc:`quickstart` before.
To get to know more feel free to address to the API and backend documentation.
There you will learn how to use shortcuts, which options should be defined in
`settings.py` and what other actions should be performed to make a certain
backend work.
